# Loca X

For our final project at Ironhack we decided to create an app where you can rent anything. For example, if you need a tent for a camping trip that lasts a couple of days, you don't have to spend a lot of money buying one: you can rent from someone at LocaX. You can also make your own itens avaiable for other people to rent and make money from stuff you already have and don't use everyday. 


## Getting started

The application is deployed at Heroku and you can access it anytime.

You can search from itens by location (for now, only Brazilian states) and then by category or keywords. If you find a product you like, you can view the details and make a reservation. 
You can also create and ad and see who is interested in renting your product.

## Stack
